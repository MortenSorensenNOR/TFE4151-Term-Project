# TFE4151 Term Project -- 8X8 Bit Memory Array
Project with the goal of designin and testing an 8x8 bit memory array with a simple read/write controller using a 90nm technology.
The project is primarily written in verilog and the designs bit cells are simulated and their power/stability measured usign AimSpice.
